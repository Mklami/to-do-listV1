This project is part of an online instructor guided course I am completing.

To run this program, you must have node.js and express.js installed.
Through a terminal, guide to the local file containing this program and write:
"node app.js", then go on a browser (like Google Chrome) and write:
"localhost:3000"

For now, it is deployed locally only on: localhost:3000
